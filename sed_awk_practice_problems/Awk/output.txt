Once there was a student named Kavya, with roll number 22B1053. Teacher gave results of some 
tests today but she seemed disappointed with Kavya. Teacher said, "Kavya, what happened 
to you ? You were the best of the best ! And now that I conducted the first test after the summer 
break, you have performed much poorly than before." Kavya said, "Ma'am, I will improve !". 
Kavya worked hard and hard everyday until one day, the roll number 22B1053 stood at the top of 
the school !!
